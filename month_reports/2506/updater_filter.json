DEL platforms allow efficient screening of libraries of billions of unique molecules against a diverse set of biological targets. This approach generates datasets well suited for machine learning (ML) methods trained to identify patterns and relationships, which then guides the design of novel compounds. Reported methods have focused on the development of ML models built from experimental datasets and thus require a successful DEL screen as a prerequisite. However, executing high-quality DEL screens is an extremely resource intensive process limited by physical factors such as protein production and availability. As such, the scale at which experimental screens and their derivative ML models can be applied is inherently limited, and some targets remain out of reach. Recently, we have developed an ML technology, DEL-AI, which overcomes these limitations and is able to accurately predict experimental DEL data given only a target protein sequence. Nurix\u2019s DEL-AI Platform is a machine learning framework designed to optimize DEL hit identification and predictive power for downstream applications without the need to first screen a protein target experimentally. Trained on the high-quality and extensive DEL archive at Nurix, our platform accurately predicts binding of multi-billion molecule DEL libraries by learning the fundamental relationships between chemical structure and protein sequence. Under this paradigm, we are able to conduct large-scale virtual Lead ID for entire therapeutic target classes.\n \n \n Elena Caceres, Cristiana Carpinteiro, Manuel Ravasqueira, Mridula Bontha, Brandon Bravo, Graham Carlson, Jim Davis, Ketki Dhamnaskar, John Eichenseer, Telmo Felgueira, Jamie Furneisen, Heta Gandhi, Jennifer Greufe, Chad Hewitt, Tim Kane, Tatiana Kennedy, Buckley Kolhauff, Emily Kruger, Ajay Kulkarni, Evan Landstrom, Calvin Larson, Emily Low, Marie Malone, Ratul Mukerji, Chris B.

Inspired by advancements in natural language processing (NLP), foundation models are increasingly used in single-cell analyses to uncover biological insights and identify clinical biomarkers. However, the performance of these models on cancer-specific tasks remains underexplored. We present an extensive evaluation of foundation models trained on millions of single-cell profiles for cancer-focused investigations.\n \n \n \n We evaluated nine predictive models-three traditional methods and six foundation models (four Geneformer and two scGPT models), across various downstream tasks. Traditional models used embeddings from high variable genes (HVG), principal components (PCA), and generative model embedding (scVI), each paired with a random forest classifier for downstream classification. The evaluated foundation models varied in architecture sizes, pretraining dataset sizes (30M to 95M cell profiles), and training datasets, which were either generic or cancer-specific. We assessed the quality of representations by measuring their predictive performance on lung cancer treatment status (TKI treated vs. treatment-naive patients) and breast cancer subtypes (ER+ vs. TNBC). We examined how model characteristics influenced their performance in these domains for all tasks.\n \n \n \n Zero-shot evaluations of the foundation models showed superior single-cell data clustering, measured by average silhouette width (ASW), compared to traditional methods (HVG, PCA, scVI), suggesting that pre-trained embeddings from millions of single-cell profiles may offer enhanced representations. We thus evaluated the learned representation on downstream predictive tasks, showing that foundation models with a larger pretraining dataset (95M cells), cancer-specific training, larger input size (4096 genes), and deeper model (12 layers) achieved the best performance among foundation models (F1=0.97) for predicting treatment status in lung cancer. In contrast, smaller and generic foundation models had significantly lower performance, however, additional self-supervised training on task-specific data rescued their performance to match larger foundation models. Similar trends were observed in predicting breast cancer subtypes. Notably, the best foundation model\u2019s performance was not significantly different from the best traditional method (PCA) in predicting breast cancer subtypes.\n \n \n \n These results highlight key factors driving foundation model performance on cancer-specific tasks.

Recent efforts have leveraged advances in natural language processing (NLP) to improve representation learning from somatic mutations by incorporating larger sequence contexts into shallow networks. More recently, studies have demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging attention mechanisms to learn meaningful representations. However, these methods primarily use supervised or weakly supervised learning paradigms, which are inherently task-specific. The development of general-purpose representations, by harnessing the vast amount of somatic mutation data through self-supervised techniques, remains underexplored. Such representations could drive progress in applications including tumor subtype classification, biomarker discovery, patient stratification, drug response prediction, and pathway enrichment analysis. This study aims to develop a deep, unsupervised learning framework that leverages abundant somatic mutation data to generate robust, general-purpose representations. By adapting recent advances in self-supervised learning, the proposed approach seeks to establish a foundation model capable of capturing meaningful patterns in mutation data for diverse downstream tasks. The framework employs novel tokenization and embedding strategies to encode mutation sequences and utilizes transformer-based architectures to model contextual dependencies. The process of inputting mutation data into a transformer architecture, particularly the tokenization step, is critical for this problem, and we explore various tokenization strategies. Benchmarking these representations will include evaluating their utility across tumor subtype classification, biomarker discovery, patient stratification, drug response prediction, identification of mutational signatures. Although the model is under development, experiments from prior work\u2014limited to mutation identifiers without leveraging sequence motifs, mutation location, or other contextual information\u2014have demonstrated the feasibility of encoding mutational data into meaningful representations using transformer-based architectures and self-supervised learning. Building on these findings, this framework will benchmark its performance on multiple downstream tasks, including tumor subtype classification and patient stratification.\n \n \n Marzieh Haghighi, Gustavo Alonso Arango Argoty, Etai Jacob.

In this work, we introduce Fleming, an AI agent designed for TB antibiotic discovery. We curated and generated the largest dataset of TB inhibitors to date (n=114,933), and used these data to train both discriminative and generative models for TB inhibitor identification. Fleming orchestrates four specialized agents\u2014a bacterial inhibition prediction agent, a molecular generation agent, a molecular optimization agent, and an ADMET agent\u2014to perform key tasks in early TB antibiotic discovery. These agents incorporate literature search capabilities and chemical optimization tools, creating an integrated platform for TB antibiotic discovery.

However, analyzing these increasingly complex datasets requires specialized expertise across computational biology, statistics, and biological context. To address this challenge, we introduce the Spatial Transcriptomics AI Agent (STAgent), an autonomous multimodal agentic AI that integrates multimodal large language models (LLMs) with specialized computational tools to transform weeks-long analysis tasks into minutes of automated processing. Unlike conventional machine learning approaches that are limited to narrow, predefined tasks, STAgent leverages the emergent capabilities of multimodal LLMs \u2013 such as flexible reasoning, contextual understanding, and cross-modal integration \u2013 which allow it to adapt to novel data, execute multi-step analyses, and generate biologically meaningful insights with minimal human input. STAgent enables autonomous deep research through integrated capabilities, including dynamic code generation for complex analytical workflows, visual reasoning for interpreting spatial patterns, real-time retrieval of relevant peer-reviewd scientific literature, and synthesis of comprehensive, actionable reports. We applied STAgent to investigate the in vivo maturation of human stem cell-derived pancreatic cells (SC-pancreas) transplanted into immunodeficient mice. We generated single-cell spatial transcriptomics data spanning multiple developmental timepoints. STAgent autonomously (1) identified the maturation of initially scattered endocrine cells into well-defined islet-like structures, with predominantly peripheral \u03b1-cells surrounding \u03b2-cell cores supported by an expanding mesenchymal network; (2) revealed strengthening endocrine-endocrine cell interactions over time and, through context-aware gene set analysis, uncovered spatially resolved biological processes driving maturation; (3) unlike traditional analytical approaches, STAgent offers mechanistic explanations of spatial patterns, contextualizing findings with relevant literatures and developing cohesive insights into human pancreatic development. This agentic approach establishes a new paradigm in spatial transcriptomics analysis by substantially lowering the expertise barrier and reducing analysis time, accelerating biological and biomedical discovery.",

To address this challenge, we developed the unified Hierarchical Annotation Framework (uHAF), which includes organ-specific hierarchical cell type trees (uHAF-T) and a mapping tool (uHAF-Agent) based on large language models. uHAF-T provides standardized hierarchical references for 38 organs, allowing for consistent label unification and analysis at different levels of granularity. uHAF-Agent leverages GPT-4 to accurately map diverse and informal cell type labels onto uHAF-T nodes, streamlining the harmonization process. By simplifying label unification, uHAF enhances data integration, supports machine learning applications, and enables biologically meaningful evaluations of annotation methods. Our framework serves as an essential resource for standardizing cell type annotations and fostering collaborative refinement in the single-cell research community.

These systems evolve under influences such as age, sex, diet, environmental exposures, and diseases, making them challenging to decode given the involvement of tens of thousands of genes and proteins. Recently, hundreds of millions of single-cell omics data have provided a robust foundation for understanding these signaling networks within various cell subpopulations and conditions. Inspired by the success of large foundation models (for example, large language models and large vision models) pre-trained on massive datasets, we introduce OmniCellTOSG, the first dataset of cell text-omic signaling graphs (TOSGs). Each TOSG represents the signaling network of an individual or meta-cell and is labeled with information such as organ, disease, sex, age, and cell subtype. OmniCellTOSG offers two key contributions. First, it introduces a novel graph model that integrates human-readable annotations -- such as biological functions, cellular locations, signaling pathways, related diseases, and drugs -- with quantitative gene and protein abundance data, enabling graph reasoning to decode cell signaling. This approach calls for new joint models combining large language models and graph neural networks. Second, the dataset is built from single-cell RNA sequencing data of approximately 120 million cells from diverse tissues and conditions (healthy and diseased) and is fully compatible with PyTorch. This facilitates the development of innovative cell signaling models that could transform research in life sciences, healthcare, and precision medicine. The OmniCellTOSG dataset is continuously expanding and will be updated regularly. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/FuhaiLiAiLab/OmniCellTOSG.",

Yet, scientists lack efficient tools to assess the scope and volume of those datasets. Data heterogeneity and limited browsing features of public databases make it challenging to efficiently search for relevant datasets based on specific criteria, such as experimental designs. We introduce the latest iteration of our solution to map and navigate public databases.\n Our solution extracts and preprocesses clinical data that serves as input for our classification models, which range from rule-based algorithms developed in collaboration with domain experts to large language models. We categorize datasets by cancer type, treatment modality, sequencing resolution, cell line identity, mutational status, and drug information. This iteration introduces models for predicting mutation and drug-related data and continuously updates mappings for existing models\u2014cancer type, technology, and treatment\u2014by incorporating new entries. Additionally, this version integrates two databases, namely \u201cGene Expression Omnibus\u201d or \u201cGEO\u201d and ArrayExpress, and includes a dashboard that allows querying and visualization of the automatically tagged datasets.\n We identified 24, 131 cancer-related, patient-derived omic datasets from GEO. Our models estimate the following: - Cancer types: the 5 most frequent indications (breast cancer, brain cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, colorectal cancer) constitute about 60% of datasets. - Technology: RNA-Seq accounts for 29% of datasets, with an estimation of 24% being single-cell and 76% bulk RNA-Seq. RNA-Seq has become the dominant technology: in 2012, the number of microarray studies published that year outnumbered RNA-Seq studies 10:1; by 2023, RNA-Seq studies published annually had overtaken microarray studies by a comparable margin. Today, the total volume of accumulated studies for each approach is nearly equal. - Treatment: approximately 25% of datasets include treatment information; post-treatment samples are estimated to represent 15%. - Mutations: information is available in 26% of datasets. Notably, 26% of colorectal cancer datasets contain mutation information, of which 35% report KRAS mutations. - Drugs: information related to antineoplastic agents is found in 11% of GEO cancer datasets.\n The analysis of ArrayExpress found 16, 255 cancer-related datasets, 77% of which also exist on GEO.\n Our unified data mapping approach streamlines the identification and querying of datasets across multiple public databases.

Building on this powerful potential, Zhang et al. proposed a semi-supervised learning framework called Autoencoder-Based Subtypes Detector for Cancer (ASD-cancer) to improve the multi-omics data analysis (H. Zhang, X. Xiong, M. Cheng, et al., 2024, mSystems 9:e01395-24, https://doi.org/10.1128/msystems.01395-24). By utilizing autoencoders pre-trained on The Cancer Genome Atlas data, the ASD-cancer framework outperforms the baseline model. This approach also makes the framework scalable, enabling it to process new data sets through transfer learning without retraining. This commentary explores the methodological innovations and scalability of ASD-cancer while suggesting future directions, such as the incorporation of additional data layers and the development of adaptive AI models through continuous learning. Notably, integrating large language models into ASD-cancer could enhance its interpretability, providing more profound insights into oncological research and increasing its influence in cancer subtyping and further analysis.",

            "abstract": "\n \n \n Characterizing the immune contexture is key to understanding the tumor microenvironment, developing biomarkers, and guiding therapeutic strategies. In our previous work on colorectal cancer (CRC), we used a pathologist-guided approach to annotate/count eosinophils and lymphocytes. Their abundance and spatial relationships with tumor cells revealed prognostic significance. While clinically valuable, identifying this demands significant pathologist effort. Advancements in AI, particularly foundational models trained on millions of histology images, have driven significant progress in digital pathology and hold promise to address this gap. However, their application to single-cell tasks remains underexplored. This study investigates the potential of foundation model and compares it with conventional convolutional neural network (CNN) using previously annotated eosinophils and lymphocytes in CRC histology images.\n \n \n \n We used 578 CRC cases in The Cancer Genome Atlas with H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) containing 8, 836, 393 cells, including 896, 322 lymphocytes and eosinophils. For evaluation, 109 WSIs were held out as a test set, with 5 WSIs per density quartile selected from our previous study. The foundational model UNI (11.2M parameters) was fine-tuned and a ResNet18 (303M parameters) model was trained. Performance was evaluated using F1-score and AUROC, with Spearman\u2019s correlation accessing WSI-level cell density correlations.\n \n \n \n For eosinophil, ResNet18 achieved an F1-score of 0.841, AUROC of 0.986, and Spearman's correlation of 0.679, compared to UNI\u2019s 0.847, 0.990, and 0.697, respectively. For lymphocytes, ResNet18 scored 0.697, 0.932, and 0.686, while UNI achieved 0.719, 0.941, and 0.662. ResNet18 performed comparably to UNI despite simpler architecture, at both cell and patient levels. Predicted cell densities generally aligned with the annotated quartiles from previous work, particularly in the 1st and 4th quartiles. Moderate density correlations (0.66-0.69) were observed, but a pathologist's review of misclassified cells revealed imperfections in the semi-supervised cell annotations.\n \n \n \n The H&E-based AI model for predicting immune cells offers a scalable alternative to manual annotation, enabling automated quantification of existing immune biomarkers like tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor-associated tissue eosinophilia. Adaptable to other tumor types, it also opens opportunities to discover novel spatial immune biomarkers by leveraging large H&E cohorts and integrating protein-stained immune cell data with histopathological knowledge. Future work will focus on enhancing performance through weakly supervised approaches using carefully selected training cells, and multi-cell type modeling to better capture the morphological characteristics of diverse cell types in a single model.\n \n \n \n Colwyn Jia Kang Lai, Wei Kit Tan, Marcia Zhang, Timothy Wang, Felicia Wee, Ai Lin Wang, Solomonraj Wilson, Tomotaka Ugai, Joe Sheng Yeong Poh, Jonathan A.
